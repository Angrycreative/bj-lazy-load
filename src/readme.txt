Lazy loading for images and iframes makes your site load faster and saves bandwidth. Uses no external JS libraries and degrades gracefully for non-js users.

== Description ==
Lazy loading makes your site load faster and saves bandwidth.

This plugin replaces all your post images, post thumbnails, gravatar images and content iframes with a placeholder and loads the content as it gets close to enter the browser window when the visitor scrolls the page. Also works with text widgets.

Since it works with iframes, it also covers embedded videoes from YouTube, Vimeo etc.

You can also lazy load other images and iframes in your theme, by using a simple filter.

Non-javascript visitors gets the original element in noscript.

Compatible with the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ricg-responsive-images/">RICG Responsive Images</a> plugin for responsive images.

== Installation ==
1. Download and unzip plugin
2. Upload the 'bj-lazy-load' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory,
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Optional usage ==
If you have images output in custom templates or want to lazy load other images in your theme, you may pass the HTML through a filter:

`<?php
$img_html = '<img src="myimage.jpg" alt="">';
$img_html = apply_filters( 'bj_lazy_load_html', $img_html );
echo $img_html;
?>`

Note for developers: The filter has a priority of 10.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Whoa, this plugin is using JavaScript. What about visitors without JS? =
No worries. They get the original element in a noscript element. No Lazy Loading for them, though.

= I'm using a CDN. Will this plugin interfere? =
Lazy loading works just fine. The images will still load from your CDN.

= How can I verify that the plugin is working? =
Check your HTML source or see the magic at work in Web Inspector, FireBug or similar.
