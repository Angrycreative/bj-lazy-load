Lazy loading makes your site load faster and saves bandwidth. Uses jQuery and degrades gracefully for non-js users. Works with both images and iframes.

== Description ==
Lazy loading makes your site load faster and saves bandwidth.

This plugin replaces all your post images, post thumbnails, gravatar images and content iframes with a placeholder and loads the content as it gets close to enter the browser window when the visitor scrolls the page.

You can also lazy load other images and iframes in your theme, by using a simple function.

Non-javascript visitors gets the original element in noscript.

= Size optimized images =
* Automaticly serve scaled down images in responsive designs (experimental)
* Automaticly serve hiDPI images for hiDPI screens (like Apples Retina Display) (experimental)

== Installation ==
1. Download and unzip plugin
2. Upload the 'bj-lazy-load' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory,
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Optional usage ==
If you have images output in custom templates or want to lazy load other images in your theme, you may pass the HTML through a filter:

`<?php
$img_html = '<img src="myimage.jpg" alt="">';
$img_html = apply_filters( 'bj_lazy_load_html', $img_html );
echo $img_html;
?>`

Note for developers: The filter has a priority of 10.

The Javascript Event `lazyload.bj` is fired when an image or iframe was loaded.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Whoa, this plugin is using JavaScript. What about visitors without JS? =
No worries. They get the original element in a noscript element. No Lazy Loading for them, though.

= Which browsers are supported? =
The included JavaScript is tested in Firefox 2+, Safari 3+, Opera 9+, Chrome 5+, Internet Explorer 6+

= I'm using a CDN. Will this plugin interfere? =
Lazy loading works just fine. The images will still load from your CDN.

As of version 0.7.1, serving responsive and hiDPI images will not work if you're using a CDN. Pull zones will be supported in the near future.

= The plugin doesn't work/doesn't replace my images =
Probably, your theme does not call wp_footer(). Edit the plugin settings to load in wp_head() instead.

= How can I verify that the plugin is working? =
Check your HTML source or see the magic at work in Web Inspector, FireBug or similar.
